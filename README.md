# CodeBin

A simple, lightweight paste bin to easily share code with one another on forums such as StackOverflow or Reddit.

### Live Demo on Netlify: [codebin1.netlify.app](https://codebin1.netlify.app)

## How to Use:

Simply paste your code into the text area and click "`Get Link`" to recieve a short, shareable link that you can share with others.
Optionally, add a password to restrict who is allowed to edit the file. By default, anyone with the link can edit the file.

To save edits, click the "`Save File`" button in the menu bar. Saving the file is only allowed for those who have edit access.

Also in the menu bar, there is a Settings icon. In the settings, you can toggle line wrapping, change the tab size, whether or not the document uses tabs or spaces for indents, and the font size of the code. There is also a "`Reset to defaults`" button that resets all settings to the default state.
